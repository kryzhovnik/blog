I'm Andrey Samsonov, a full-stack software developer, living in Serbia, Novi Sad

I build reliable, pragmatic Ruby on Rails products that keep everyday work simple. For 14+ years, I've been shipping and maintaining customer-facing apps with substantial internal back-office functionality—often solo, for small businesses that can't afford a big team.

Currently, I'm building an agentic education app—exploring how technology can make personalized learning a reality.
